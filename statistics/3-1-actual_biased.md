[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

In this exercise we are looking at the effects of biases on Probability Mass Functions (PMF).  In this case we are looking at data gathered from households, one sample represents the number of children in all families and the other sample represents families where the children are asked for the number of children in their family.  In the second case, the distribution is biased as families with no children are not sampled at all and families with larger amounts of children are oversampled in proportion to their size as larger families have more samples to draw from.  The two distributions are ploted below:

As you can see a large portion of the unbiased PMF has 0 kids, which is completely ignored in the sample for the biased PMF.  I then calculated the means for both PMFs and got 1.024 for the unbiased distribution and 2.404 for the second distrubtion.  This is obviously a large difference and can be attributed to the factors relating to the bias of the distribution.
